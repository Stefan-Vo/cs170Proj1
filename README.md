Eight-Puzzle Solver
This repository contains a Python program that solves the classic Eight-Puzzle problem using three different search algorithms:

Uniform Cost Search: Explores the state space using a cost-based approach, prioritizing nodes with lower path costs.
A with Misplaced Tile Heuristic*: Utilizes the A* search algorithm along with the Misplaced Tile heuristic to guide the search towards the goal state. The heuristic estimates the number of misplaced tiles in each state.
A with Euclidean Distance Heuristic*: Employs the A* search algorithm with the Euclidean Distance heuristic, which calculates the distance between each tile's current position and its goal position.
