## Eight-Puzzle Solver

This repository contains a Python program that solves the classic Eight-Puzzle problem using three different search algorithms:

1. **Uniform Cost Search**: Explores the state space using a cost-based approach, prioritizing nodes with lower path costs.

2. **A* with Misplaced Tile Heuristic**: Utilizes the A* search algorithm along with the Misplaced Tile heuristic to guide the search towards the goal state. The heuristic estimates the number of misplaced tiles in each state.

3. **A* with Euclidean Distance Heuristic**: Employs the A* search algorithm with the Euclidean Distance heuristic, which calculates the distance between each tile's current position and its goal position.
